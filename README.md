# bread-virtual-meetings

The default presentation in [bread](https://github.com/bmlt-enabled/bread) for virtual meetings that are replacing an
in-person meeting seems potentially misleading, since it may be easy to overlook the TC key and go to a closed meeting
location. This extension fixes up those listings by adding a note in front of the facility name, and removing the address.
